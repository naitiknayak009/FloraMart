      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        At Flora Mart, we are dedicated to bringing the beauty of nature right to your doorstep. Our mission is to deliver high-quality plants directly to your home, making it easier for you to create a green and vibrant living space.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in sustainability and eco-friendliness. That&apos;s why we recycle unhealthy or unwanted plants to create nutrient-rich manure. This not only reduces waste but also enriches the soil for healthier plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to our plant delivery service, we offer a variety of decorative plant pots available on our website. Our pots are designed to enhance the beauty of your plants while complementing your home decor.
